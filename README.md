Before run the project, you need to create a .env file in the root directory of the project with the following content:

```
# jwt secret
JWT_SECRET=...

# port
PORT=...

# database
DB_HOST=...
DB_PORT=...
DB_USER=...
DB_PASSWORD=...
DB_NAME=...
```

and run the command `npm i` to install the dependencies.

After that, you can run the project with the command `npm run start`.
